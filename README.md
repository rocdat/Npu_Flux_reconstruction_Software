# NFS

NFS is NPU Flux reconstruction Software. Based on GFR, NFS is developed to handle unstructured mesh with the Flux Reconstruction scheme for high order simulation of turbulence. GFR is originally from NASA. Its repo is https://github.com/nasa/GFR.

# TODO list

- High order restarted from low order solution file
- Restart time averaged wall surface solutions
- BDF2 time scheme (LUSGS)
- Custom profile BC
- Custom profile initialization
- Turbulence generation BC via the digital filter
- Time averaged vorticity
